# Portfolio

## Project Goals
Create a React web application that uses components to build a website that showcases your about me, portfolio projects and contact information.

## Project features:
- React to create the app's user interface. It will allow us to compose each part of our landing page through reusable components and extend our app if we want to add additional features, such as a blog.
- To style our application, Tailwind CSS. To give our app a professional appearance, Tailwind will allow us to easily apply multiple styles through combining classnames on our React elements.

## Built with
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Node.js
- Git, Github

## How to Use

### Run application
In the project directory, you can run:

#### npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

#### npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### Deployment
See the section about deployment for more information here https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment

#### npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
